# Project Title

This project consists of three tasks in Java, JavaScript, and HTML. Additionally, it includes a `README.md` file that provides an overview of the project.

## Task 1: Java

### A. Shuffle an Array

In this task, we shuffle an array of values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) using the Fisher-Yates algorithm.

### B. Roman to Integer Conversion

Here, we convert a Roman numeral input to an integer.

### C. Pangram Check

We check if a given input is a pangram, which means it contains all the alphabets from 'a' to 'z'.

## Task 2: JavaScript

### A. Reverse Words in a Sentence

In this task, we reverse every word in a sentence. For example, "This is a sunny day" becomes "sihT si a ynnus yad."

### B. Sort an Array in Descending Order

We sort an array of numbers in descending order.

## Task 3: HTML

### A. Basic Calculator

We create a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

### B. Survey Form

This task involves creating a survey form with various input fields and validation. It also includes "Submit" and "Reset" buttons. Upon submission, a popup displays the selected values with labels. Closing the popup resets the form.
